    "# Getting Started with RAPIDS on SageMaker Studio Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "So you want to run RAPIDS on SageMaker Studio Lab?  Well, here's a great entry point.  Below, you will see a section on\n",
    "1. **[Installing RAPIDS](#Installing-RAPIDS)**- installation methods to get RAPIDS onto SageMaker Studio Lab\n",
    "1.  **[Links to RAPIDS Notebooks and Repos](#Links-to-RAPIDS-Notebooks-and-Repos)** - ready to run examples that you can quickly import into to SageMaker Studio Lab and run\n",
    "1. **[Tips and Tricks](#Tips-and-Tricks)**- Get the most out of your RAPIDS + SageMaker Studio Lab Expereince\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this guide, you only need two things:\n",
    "1. An active SageMaker Studio Lab account (get one here: https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)\n",
    "1. An actively running GPU instance in that account\n",
    "\n",
    "Please Github Clone the entire so that you can pull the latest source of this page and keep it update (more on how later).  RAPIDS versions do change, as will the install script.  New Tips and Tricks also will be added as they are discovered.\n",

    "## Installing RAPIDS\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the cool things about SageMaker Studio Lab is that your instance is persistant, so what you install today will keep going until you delete it.  It will be like using a docker container.  That means that you will only need to run the install script ONCE per RAPIDS Stable release.  With Nightlies, you will download and install on every release that you want to run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Clone this Repo and Auto-Install the Current RAPIDS Stable Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Easiest way to install RAPIDS into SageMaker Studio Lab:\n",
    "1. Click this button [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://rapids.ai/smsl.html)\n",
    "2. Click the `Copy to Project` button\n",
    "3. When prompted, select `Clone Entire Repo`\n",
    "4. After customizing any directories, ensure that `Search for environment.yml and build Conda environment` is checked and click `Clone`\n",
    "5. Once completed, please go to **[Links to RAPIDS Notebooks and Repos](#Links-to-RAPIDS-Notebooks-and-Repos)** and get some Notebooks to run RAPIDS on!\n",
